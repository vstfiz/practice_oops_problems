Answer To The Practise Viva Questions:

Question-1 : What is OOPs?

Solution : Object Oriented Programming is a programming concept that works on the principle that objects are the most important part of your program. It allows users create the objects that they want and then create methods to handle those objects. Manipulating these objects to get results is the goal of Object Oriented Programming.

Question-2 : What are the advantages of OOPS concepts?

Solution : The advantages of OOP are mentioned below:

    OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.
    
    It is good for defining abstract data types.
    
    Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.
    
    It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.
    objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages
    
    Encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.
    
    It implements real life scenario.
    
    In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures.
    
Question-3 : What is the difference between Procedural programming and OOPS?

Solutions :

Procedural Programming:
Procedural Programming can be defined as a programming model which is derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of calling procedure. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines or functions, simply consist of a series of computational steps to be carried out. During a program’s execution, any given procedure might be called at any point, including by other procedures or itself.

Object Oriented Programming:
Object oriented programming can be defined as a programming model which is based upon the concept of objects. Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. In object oriented programming, computer programs are designed using the concept of objects that interact with real world. Object oriented programming languages are various but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

Question-4 : What are the core concepts of OOPS?

Solution : 

Core OOPS concepts are:

    Abstraction
    Encapsulation
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance
    Association
    Aggregation
    Composition
    
Question-5 : What is Abstraction?

Solution : Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

Question-6 : What is Encapsulation?
Solution : Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, e.g., a class in Java.

Question-7:  What is the difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation?
Solution : Both Abstraction and Encapsulation are two of the four basic OOP concepts which allow you to model real-world things into objects so that you can implement them in your program and code.Abstraction hides complexity by giving you a more abstract picture, a sort of 10,000 feet view, while Encapsulation hides internal working so that you can change it later. In other words, Abstraction hides details at the design level, while Encapsulation hides details at the implementation level.

Question-8 : What is Polymorphism?
Solution : The term polymorphism simply means ‘one function, multiple forms’. Polymorphism is achieved at both compile time and run time. The compile time polymorphism is achieved through “overloading” whereas, the run time polymorphism is achieved through “overriding”.The polymorphism allows the object to decide “which form of the function to be invoked when” at both, compile time and run time.

Question-9 : What is Inheritance?
Solution : Inheritance is one of the crucial features of OOP, which strongly support “reusability”. Reusability could be described as creating a new class by reusing the properties of the existing class. In inheritance, there is a base class, which is inherited by the derived class. When a class inherits any other class, the member(s) of the base class becomes the member(s) of a derived class.In Java, the class inherits the other class by using the keyword “extends”. In Java, the base class is referred as a super class, and derived class is referred as a subclass. A subclass can not access those members of the base class, which are declared as “private”.

Question-10 : What is multiple inheritance?
Solution : Multiple Inheritance is a feature of object oriented concept, where a class can inherit properties of more than one parent class. The problem occurs when there exist methods with same signature in both the super classes and subclass. On calling the method, the compiler cannot determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority. 

Question-11 : What is the diamond problem in inheritance?
Solution : The "diamond problem" (sometimes referred to as the "Deadly Diamond of Death") is an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C?
