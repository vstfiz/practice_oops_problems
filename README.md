    It is good for defining abstract data types.
    
    Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.
    
    It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.
    objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages
    
    Encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.
